# Cover Letter App

This is a very basic cover letter app built in React. It is meant to be contained in one file and opened directly in the browser.

### Installation
All you need is the single index.html file. To edit the copy, find the Cover component, where the state is set. The nav will update based on the number of objects found in the array of "sections".
